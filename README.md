# AI Stock Forecasting

This repository showcases an AI-driven stock forecasting project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict next-day stock prices. This is accomplished by performing sentiment analysis on stock-specific financial news and considering recent market dynamics.

**NOTE**: This codebase is currently under development, with preliminary results available. This project is far from complete, as I intend eventually to enhance the code, improve its robustness, clean it up, and add detailed explanations to this README.md file.

## Dependencies

Some important Python libraries that this project relies on include:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs)
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
